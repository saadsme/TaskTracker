# Task Tracker

Built using React.js for the front-end and MongoDB as the preffered database.

This is a to-do list app, which takes task name, due date, and reminder option.

Functionality:
  - Add tasks
  - Set reminder for a task on double click
  - Delete Tasks

This is personal project made with the help of Traversy Media's React Crash Course.
